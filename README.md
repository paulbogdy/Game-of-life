# Game-of-life

An implementation of Game of Life in python, using pygame.

For this I used a sparse matrix and relative positioning, so that the game looks infinite.

I've already provided a glider gun text file. In order to add any kind of configuration, just add a file with coordonates and load it in main, instead of the glider gun file.
